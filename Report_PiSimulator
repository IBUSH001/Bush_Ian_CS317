The simulator was fairly simple to work out. While it had been stated that it would take 1,000,000-10,000,000 to create an accurate approximation of pi, I managed to get consistently within that range with 100,000 dart throws. There were a few that were in the 3.13 range, but since that is less than 0.01 than the desired result, they were counted as a success case. 

From a sample size of 10 games, I got a standard deviation of 4.34 * 10^-3.
